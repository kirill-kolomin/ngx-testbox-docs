# NgxTestbox

A comprehensive testing utility library for Angular applications that simplifies test writing and improves test reliability.

You can find this library useful for unit / integration/ e2e testing.
It unleashes all power with integration testing of components when you use all functionality together with each other.
It gives you everything that you need to test your components against the behavior of elements on the screen and responses from server side.

You are the guy who will simulate responses on HTTP requests using only functions of this library, reducing dependencies on network / backend server / infrastructure of your project.
Though your application becomes self-sufficient to keep all user stories covered with tests!
Make your application harder to brake and bug-proof with this awesome opportunity!

This guideline explains the initial issue, sets constraints, and shows on examples how to use ngx-testbox: [Testing Angular Components](https://kirill-kolomin.github.io/ngx-testbox/)

## Installation

```bash
npm install ngx-testbox
```

## Library Modules

NgxTestbox consists of two main modules:

1. **Core Module** - Provides directives for marking elements for testing
2. **Testing Module** - Provides utilities for testing Angular applications

## Core Module

The core module provides directives for marking elements with test IDs that can be used in tests.

### TestIdDirective

A unified way of marking your elements on screen with a unique identifier for testing purposes.
A directive that adds a `data-test-id` attribute to DOM elements for testing purposes.
It sets the data-test-id attribute on a dom node, which is accessible with any test frameworks: Cypress, Jasmine, Jest, etc.
The value of the attribute will be the same string that you passed into the input.

#### Usage

First of all, you need to create your test ids:

```typescript
import { TestIdDirective } from 'ngx-testbox';

const TEST_IDS = ['submitButton', 'cancelButton'] as const;
const idsMap = TestIdDirective.idsToMap(TEST_IDS);

// Now you can use idsMap.submitButton and idsMap.cancelButton in your component and tests.
// The idsToMap method creates a type-safe map where both keys and values are the same strings.
```

Pass them to a component.

```typescript
import { TestIdDirective } from 'ngx-testbox';
import { idsMap } from './test-ids';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: `<button [testboxTestId]="idsMap.submitButton">Submit</button>`,
  standalone: true,
  imports: [TestIdDirective]
})
export class ExampleComponent {
  idsMap = idsMap
}
```

In your tests, you can select elements by their test ID:

```typescript
const submitButton = fixture.debugElement.query(By.css('[data-test-id="submit-button"]'));
// Or a much more convenient way is to use DebugElementHarness, see next chapters
```

## Testing Module

The testing module provides utilities for testing Angular applications, particularly for handling HTTP calls, debugging elements, and managing asynchronous operations.

### runTasksUntilStable

Runs Angular change detection and processes tasks until the component fixture is stable.
This function is designed to help with testing asynchronous operations in Angular components.

The function repeatedly runs change detection and advances the virtual clock until the fixture
is stable. It also handles HTTP requests if instructions are provided. If the fixture cannot
be stabilized after a maximum number of attempts, an error is thrown.

```typescript
import { runTasksUntilStable } from 'ngx-testbox/testing';
import { fakeAsync } from '@angular/core/testing';

it('should load data after initialization', fakeAsync(() => {
  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);

  // Run tasks until the fixture is stable
  runTasksUntilStable(fixture);

  // Now you can make assertions
  expect(fixture.componentInstance.data).toBeDefined();
}));

// With HTTP call instructions
it('should handle HTTP requests', fakeAsync(() => {
  const fixture = TestBed.createComponent(MyComponent);

  runTasksUntilStable(fixture, {
    httpCallInstructions: [
      [['api/users', 'GET'], () => new HttpResponse({ body: users, status: 200 })]
    ]
  });

  // Now you can make assertions
  expect(fixture.componentInstance.users).toEqual(users);
}));
```

**Throws**:
- Error if the fixture cannot be stabilized after maximum attempts
- Error if any HTTP instruction is not invoked during stabilization
- Error if any HTTP request is not handled during stabilization

**Remarks**:
- This function is designed to work only within fakeAsync zone.
- When you created a component using the method createComponent of fixture, the fixture is still marked as stable, if you don't run any asynchronous tasks within the component constructor or within its dependencies.
  Make sure you set everything up (did overrides to methods, passed values to inputs, etc.), as you need to call the runTasksUntilStable function to run the Angular component's life cycle.
  Once you called it, the ngOnInit method will be invoked, and the fixture now is in status unstable.
- This function processes only HTTP requests made using Angular HTTP client.
- To guarantee that your passed HTTP call instructions will be invoked, the function will throw if some of them were not invoked during stabilization. This is useful for cases when you initialize your component with some data as the initial state, and your test case covers error responses, which preserve the initial state.
- If you didn't process any of the HTTP requests that entered the queue of tasks, the function will throw an error. This helps you to cover that piece of code you expect to cover.
- When your code uses setInterval calls, this may cause problems for stabilizing the fixture. You might need to mock the place where setInterval is invoked or run the code outside the Angular zone using NgZone.prototype.runOutsideAngular. Additionally, you will receive warnings in the console log if setInterval is detected with stack trace pointing you to easier find the place where setInterval is invoked.

### completeHttpCalls

Completes all HTTP calls that are in the queue and processes all subsequent tasks.
This function only handles HTTP requests that were scheduled using the Angular HttpClient.

For each request in the queue, it finds a matching instruction from the provided array
and uses it to generate and flush an appropriate response.

```typescript
import { completeHttpCalls } from 'ngx-testbox/testing';
import { HttpResponse } from '@angular/common/http';

// In a fakeAsync test
completeHttpCalls([
  [['api/users', 'GET'], () => new HttpResponse({ body: users, status: 200 })]
]);
```

**Parameters**:
- `httpCallInstructions` - An array of instructions defining how to handle specific HTTP requests
- `options` (optional) - Configuration options
    - `httpTestingController` - The HTTP testing controller instance (defaults to the one from TestBed)

**Throws**:
- Error if matching instruction is not found for a request

### debugElementHarness

A utility class that provides a convenient API for interacting with elements in tests using test IDs.

This class simplifies the process of querying for elements and performing common actions like clicking,
focusing, and getting text content. It works with elements that have a test ID attribute, be default with ID attributes that applied by the TestIdDirective.

```typescript
import { DebugElementHarness } from 'ngx-testbox/testing';

// Define test IDs
const TEST_IDS = ['submitButton', 'cancelButton'] as const;

// Create a harness
const harness = new DebugElementHarness(fixture.debugElement, TEST_IDS);

// Query elements
const submitButton = harness.elements.submitButton.query();

// Interact with elements
harness.elements.submitButton.click();
harness.elements.cancelButton.focus();

// Get text content
const buttonText = harness.elements.submitButton.getTextContent();
```

**Type Parameters**:
- `TestIds` - A readonly array of string literals representing the test IDs to be used

**Properties**:
- `elements` - A record of element APIs for each test ID, providing access to methods for each element identified by a test ID

**Constructor Parameters**:
- `debugElement` - The root debug element to search within
- `testIds` - An array of test IDs to create element APIs for
- `testIdAttribute` - The attribute name used for test IDs (default: 'data-test-id')

### passTime

Advances the virtual clock by the specified amount of time and processes all microtasks.

This utility function is useful in Angular tests to simulate the passage of time
for testing asynchronous operations like timeouts, intervals, and promises.

```typescript
import { passTime } from 'ngx-testbox/testing';
import { fakeAsync } from '@angular/core/testing';

it('should update after timeout', fakeAsync(() => {
  // Setup component
  component.startTimer();

  // Advance time by default 1000ms
  passTime();
  expect(component.timerCompleted).toBeTrue();

  // With custom time
  component.startLongProcess();
  passTime(5000); // Advances time by 5000ms
  expect(component.processCompleted).toBeTrue();
}));
```

**Parameters**:
- `time` - The amount of time in milliseconds to advance (defaults to 1000ms)

### predefinedHttpCallInstructions

A collection of predefined HTTP call instructions for different HTTP methods and status types.

This object provides a convenient way to create HTTP call instructions for testing without
having to manually specify the status codes and response formats. It supports all common
HTTP methods and both success and error responses.

```typescript
import { predefinedHttpCallInstructions } from 'ngx-testbox/testing';

// Create a GET request with a success response
const getSuccess = predefinedHttpCallInstructions.get.success('api/users');

// Create a POST request with an error response and custom response body
const postError = predefinedHttpCallInstructions.post.error('api/users',
  () => ({ error: 'User already exists' }));

// Use with runTasksUntilStable
runTasksUntilStable(fixture, {httpCallInstructions: [getSuccess, postError]});

// Or use with completeHttpCalls
completeHttpCalls([getSuccess, postError]);
```

**Supported HTTP Methods**:
- HEAD
- OPTIONS
- GET
- POST
- PUT
- PATCH
- DELETE

**Supported Status Types**:
- success (returns 200 OK)
- error (returns 500 Internal Server Error)

## Future Development Ideas

- Integrate HTTP calls flushing with GraphQL and websockets
- Integrate with all Angular versions
